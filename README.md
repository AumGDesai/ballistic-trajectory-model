# Ballistic Trajectory Model

This is a simple Python project that models projectile motion using basic physics principles. The unique aspect of this implementation is that it **intentionally avoids using loops**, relying instead on **functional programming techniques** such as recursion and higher-order functions.


## üß† Key Concepts

- Functional programming in Python
- Recursion over iteration
- Modeling projectile motion (basic kinematics)
- Working with tabular data using `.csv` files

## üêç Technologies Used

- Python 3.x (no external libraries required)
- Standard Python libraries only (`math`, `csv`)

## üìÇ Files

- `addthree.py`: Functional example for adding numbers
- `extension.py`: Main logic for computing projectile trajectories
- `gendata.py`: Generates simulated launch data
- `data.csv` / `extensiondata.csv`: Input/output data for the simulations
